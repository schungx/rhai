//! What a `Dynamic` is, on the machine that wrote the artifact.
//!
//! Rhai's feature flags change the value representation rather than just what
//! is available: `f32_float` makes `FLOAT` an `f32`, `only_i32` narrows `INT`,
//! `sync` swaps `Rc` for `Arc`. Loading an artifact across one of those is not
//! a missing feature, it is a value decoded as the wrong type — so the header
//! carries a fingerprint and the loader refuses a mismatch by name.
//!
//! ## What the fingerprint can and cannot see
//!
//! Widths are *measured*, so they are right no matter how rhai was configured.
//! The booleans are read from this crate's own features, which is why the
//! manifest mirrors them — `cfg!(feature = "no_object")` here does not consult
//! rhai's manifest.
//!
//! That leaves one gap: enabling a restriction on rhai directly, bypassing the
//! mirror. The cross-checks below close it wherever rust can prove the
//! disagreement, turning it into a compile error rather than a wrong
//! fingerprint. They cannot close it everywhere, which is what the mirror is
//! documented for.

/// Restrictions that are not visible in a width.
///
/// Order is the wire order and must never change; append only. A flag's name
/// is what the loader reports, so it has to match rhai's own spelling.
