//! Compiled code must still be stoppable.
//!
//! Rhai enforces `max_operations` and the `on_progress` interrupt from
//! `Engine::track_operation`, which the tree walker calls per AST node. A VM
//! that never called it would turn `loop {}` from a script the engine
//! terminates into one that hangs the host — a safety regression, not a
//! performance one, which is why `track_operation` is in the patch.
//!
//! These live outside the differential corpus on purpose. The walker ticks per
//! node and the VM ticks per loop back-edge, so the operation *counts* differ
//! and always will. What must hold is that the limit fires and the interrupt is
//! honoured, so that is what is asserted — not parity of counts or positions.
