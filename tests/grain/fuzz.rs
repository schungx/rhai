//!
//! `no_single_bit_flip_can_panic_or_smuggle_a_bad_chunk` in `format.rs` is the

//! half: many mutations, several of them structural, over a corpus of real
//! artifacts. Seeded rather than random, so a failure is reproducible and CI
//! does not go intermittent — the seed is printed and any interesting input is
